# Performance Optimization
 This repo contains all the assignments done in course Performance Optimization course at BTH.

The goal is to conduct performance testing of an image transformation application and produce an analysis of the baseline performance and bottlenecks using Valgrind and Kcache tools.
For this project, we used C++ (including its subset of C).
Overall, the lab report provides comprehensive insights into hardware characteristics analysis and performance monitoring on a Debian system. The detailed commands and outputs facilitate efficient performance evaluation and troubleshooting.
